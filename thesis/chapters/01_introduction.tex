\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}

Graphs are one of the most prominent combinatorial structures in computer science and mathematics.
When one proves a graph theoretic statement and especially when complicated graph properties are involved, one sometimes resorts to exhaustive search.
This can help find specific instances like counterexamples or count the number of instances of a specific type of graph.
The enumeration of combinatorial structures is usually done by computer software.
Especially in mathematical settings the correctness of the enumeration algorithm is of utmost importance.
This involved using methods of formal program verification to show correctness.

In this thesis, we will focus on the generation of trees (connected acyclic graphs).
An algorithm for the enumeration of trees over a given set of vertices as well as an algorithm for the enumeration of unlabeled, rooted trees are described and their correctness proved in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.
