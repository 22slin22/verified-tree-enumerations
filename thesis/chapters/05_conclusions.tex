\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chapter:conclusions}

The aim of this thesis was to formalize algorithms for the enumeration of trees and to prove their correctness.
Algorithms for the enumeration of labeled trees and unlabeled, rooted trees were described and successfully verified in Isabelle/HOL.
To accomplish this, trees and other graph theoretic results were formalized as well.
These results can be used by a wide variety of other projects involving trees or undirected graphs in general.

Furthermore, there are other algorithms for the enumeration of other tree structures that could be formalized in future projects.
This includes algorithms for the generation of free trees~\cite{Wright1986ConstantTG} or spanning trees of graphs~\cite{SpanningTreeEnumetaion}.
